# The Woagpad

## A macropad of all time

## Features

- **Rust based firmware**: Through the power of [rmk](https://haobogu.github.io/rmk), the firmware is written in 100% Rust. Crab gaming :crab:
  - [VIAL](https://get.vial.today/) support OOTB
- **128x32 OLED Display**: Display whatever the hell you want*
- **2 EC11 Rotary Encoders**: Control your volume or scroll through pages with these*
- **3x3 key matrix**: Keypad, macro, media controls, whatever the hell you want. You have 9 keys to mess around with (this includes the push buttons on the rotary encoders)

*The default rmk firmware does not support OLED display or rotary encoders yet.
Once those are implemented, the firmware will be updated to support them.
Write your own firmware to take advantage of these features!
